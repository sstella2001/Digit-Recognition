# Didgit Recognition
Digit Recognition is a program that recognizes handwritten digits using Tensorflow.

The model_creation.py file uses a Keras Sequential system to create a model that predicts Handwritten digits (from 0-9). The MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset is used to train the model. It consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples

The ocr.py files uses the PyQt5 library to ceate a user friendly interface that puts the model from the previous file to practical use.
